            I'm <strong>Siddharth Nirgude</strong>, a passionate and detail-oriented Full Stack Developer with over 4
            years of experience.
            I specialize in building scalable web applications using .NET technologies and Angular. I have a strong
            understanding of both front-end and back-end development, and I thrive on solving real-world problems

            I love diving into microservices architecture, using modern tools like Module Federation, RabbitMQ, and
            implementing secure and reliable APIs. Whether it's working from the client's location or collaborating
            remotely, I adapt quickly and deliver top-quality solutions.
